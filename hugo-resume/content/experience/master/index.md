**Research Focus:**

Research focused on **Sparse Network Coding: Embedding Feedback Mechanisms in Analytical Models**: In 2017, I was accepted as a master's student with an exceptional talents scholarship to pursue my studies at the [Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS)](https://iasbs.ac.ir/en) under the supervision of [Dr. Peyman Pahlevani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y0fAbOEAAAAJ&hl=en). During my time there, I developed an innovative Analytical Model for [Sparse Network Coding in Feedback-Based Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_network_coding), to enhance the security and reliability of sparse network coded channels in wireless sensor networks. This model combines the use of Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) and Network Coding (NC) techniques.

- Graduated with a GPA of **18.28 / 20.00**.
- Supervised by [Dr. Peyman Pahlevani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y0fAbOEAAAAJ&hl=en).
- Developed novel analytical models for feedback mechanisms in network coding.
- **Awarded admission via competitive interview under the Exceptional Talents Scholarship, bypassing the national entrance exam**.
- Selected for the [Erasmus+ GraDAna School at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/erasmus-en/) (2019).
- Conference Staff Member at the [International Conference on Contemporary Issues in Data Science (CiDaS)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-37309-2) (2019).
- Served as a teaching assistant for advanced computer networks, data science, and machine learning courses.
